# HALE

The purpose of this exercise is to investigate the ideas of **expansion** and **compression** with respect to HALE and life expectancy. The data was downloaded from this [web tool](http://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-results-tool) with these configurations([life exp.](http://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-results-tool?params=querytool-permalink/4dde0ac01d08f4064e8432a25222fd70), [hale](http://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-results-tool?params=querytool-permalink/804498678fe754b7cab1af238106c9ae)).

Additional data downloaded from:

- [Location hierarchy](http://ghdx.healthdata.org/record/global-burden-disease-study-2015-gbd-2015-location-hierarchies)

## Questions
In this exercise, you should answer the following questions using the data provided (it may be helpful to use the `-wide` data in some instances). Before you begin, consider **how to assess compression/expansion** given life expectancy and hale data.

- Are HALE and life expectancy correlated (visually, statistically)?
	> HALE and life expectancy have a direct relationship where one increases proportionally with the other.
- As life expectancy increases, at what rate does hale increase?
-
